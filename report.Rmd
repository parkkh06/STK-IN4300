# 1. Summary Statistics Table
Summarizes the information in the data on a variable level.


```{r cars}

```

# 2. Bad Data Visualization

For at least one categorical and one continuous variable in your data, make a bad plot and explain why it is bad and possibly even misleading.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

# 3. Good Data Visualization

Provide a good version of the bad plot(s) from Problem 2 and explain how the plot has been improved.

# 4. Simple analysis

Perform linear regression on the data, including some method for performing model selection.

Include some measure of performance on the final model.

Based both on the analysis and your previous visualizations, evaluate whether a linear model is sufficient.
